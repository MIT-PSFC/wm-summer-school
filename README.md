# "AI/ML For Fusion"

### Database preparation workflows

This repository holds the database preparation workflows used to provide fusion data for the W&M Summer School "AI/ML For Fusion".

The yearly summer school is sponsored by DOE under the project "Open and FAIR Fusion for Machine Learning Applications" (2024-2026), led by MIT PSFC.
Under the same grant, the disruption-py framework has been greatly improved.

The present workflows extract Alcator C-MOD data from the MDSplus servers, and are designed to be run on the MFE workstations at MIT PSFC.
